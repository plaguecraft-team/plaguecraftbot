I've completely rewrote the entry script and made some internal changes to the bot!

1 - Added the token to an ignored .env file (New req: dotenv)
2 - Added argument checks to the kick, ban, and mute/unmute commands (returns if there are no mentions)
3 - Added gitignore file to keep some stuff from showing
4 - Changed how the backend lookups show (embeds)
5 - Corrected some spelling
6 - Changed main JS file from 'index.js' to 'bot.js'
7 - Implemented the Liscense file
8 - Added logging in all of our moderation commands
9 - Cleared up some commands, added more embeds nd stuff lmao
